Description: Enables the user to calculate Value at Risk (VaR)
    and Expected Shortfall (ES) by means of various types of historical
    simulation. Currently plain historical simulation as well as age- and
    volatility-weighted historical simulation are implemented in this
    package. Volatility weighting is carried out via an exponentially
    weighted moving average (EWMA).  The methods of the package are
    described in Gurrola-Perez, P. and Murphy, D. (2015)
    <https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:boe:boeewp:0525>.
